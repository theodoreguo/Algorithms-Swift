/**
 A linked list is a sequence of data items, just like an array. But where an array allocates a big block of memory to store the objects, the elements in a linked list are totally separate objects in memory and are connected through links:
 
 +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+
 |        |    |        |    |        |    |        |
 | node 0 |--->| node 1 |--->| node 2 |--->| node 3 |
 |        |    |        |    |        |    |        |
 +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+
 
 The elements of a linked list are referred to as nodes. The above picture shows a singly linked list, where each node only has a reference -- or a "pointer" -- to the next node. In a doubly linked list, shown below, nodes also have pointers to the previous node:
 
 +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+
 |        |--->|        |--->|        |--->|        |
 | node 0 |    | node 1 |    | node 2 |    | node 3 |
 |        |<---|        |<---|        |<---|        |
 +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+
 
 You need to keep track of where the list begins. That's usually done with a pointer called the head:
 
          +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+
 head --->|        |--->|        |--->|        |--->|        |---> nil
          | node 0 |    | node 1 |    | node 2 |    | node 3 |
  nil <---|        |<---|        |<---|        |<---|        |<--- tail
          +--------+    +--------+    +--------+    +--------+
 
 It's also useful to have a reference to the end of the list, known as the tail. Note that the "next" pointer of the last node is nil, just like the "previous" pointer of the very first node.
 
 Performance of linked lists
 
 Most operations on a linked list have O(n) time, so linked lists are generally slower than arrays. However, they are also much more flexible -- rather than having to copy large chunks of memory around as with an array, many operations on a linked list just require you to change a few pointers.
 
 The reason for the O(n) time is that you can't simply write list[2] to access node 2 from the list. If you don't have a reference to that node already, you have to start at the head and work your way down to that node by following the next pointers (or start at the tail and work your way back using the previous pointers).
 
 But once you have a reference to a node, operations like insertion and deletion are really quick. It's just that finding the node is slow.
 
 This means that when you're dealing with a linked list, you should insert new items at the front whenever possible. That is an O(1) operation. Likewise for inserting at the back if you're keeping track of the tail pointer.
 
 Singly vs doubly linked lists
 
 A singly linked list uses a little less memory than a doubly linked list because it doesn't need to store all those previous pointers.
 
 But if you have a node and you need to find its previous node, you're screwed. You have to start at the head of the list and iterate through the entire list until you get to the right node.
 
 For many tasks, a doubly linked list makes things easier.
 
 Why use a linked list?
 
 A typical example of where to use a linked list is when you need a queue. With an array, removing elements from the front of the queue is slow because it needs to shift down all the other elements in memory. But with a linked list it's just a matter of changing head to point to the second element. Much faster.
 
 But to be honest, you hardly ever need to write your own linked list these days. Still, it's useful to understand how they work; the principle of linking objects together is also used with trees and graphs.
 
 Note:
 
 Linked lists are flexible but many operations are O(n).
 
 When performing operations on a linked list, you always need to be careful to update the relevant next and previous pointers, and possibly also the head and tail pointers. If you mess this up, your list will no longer be correct and your program will likely crash at some point. 
 
 When processing lists, you can often use recursion: process the first element and then recursively call the function again on the rest of the list. Youâ€™re done when there is no next element. This is why linked lists are the foundation of functional programming languages such as LISP.

     Helper function
     It returns a tuple containing the node currently at the specified index and the node that immediately precedes it, if any. The loop is very similar to nodeAt(), except that here we also keep track of what the previous node is as we iterate through the list.
     
     Let's look at an example. Suppose we have the following list:
     
     head --> A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> nil
     
     We want to find the nodes before and after index 3. As we start the loop, i = 3, next points at "A", and prev is nil.
     
     head --> A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> nil
             next
     
     We decrement i, make prev point to "A", and move next to the next node, "B":
     
     head --> A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> nil
             prev  next
     
     Again, we decrement i and update the pointers. Now prev points to "B", and next points to "C":
     
     head --> A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> nil
                   prev  next
     
     As you can see, prev always follows one behind next. We do this one more time and then i equals 0 and we exit the loop:
     
     head --> A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> nil
                         prev  next
     
     The assert() after the loop checks whether there really were enough nodes in the list. If i > 0 at this point, then the specified index was too large.
     
     Note: If any of the loops in this article don't make much sense to you, then draw a linked list on a piece of paper and step through the loop by hand, just like what we did here.
     
     For this example, the function returns ("C", "D") because "D" is the node at index 3 and "C" is the one right before that.

     Method for inserting nodesa method that lets you insert a new node at any index in the list.
     
     Some remarks about this method:
     
        1. First, we need to find where to insert this node. After calling the helper method, prev points to the previous node and next is the node currently at the given index. We'll insert the new node in between these two. Note that prev can be nil (index is 0), next can be nil (index equals size of the list), or both can be nil if the list is empty.
     
        2. Create the new node and connect the previous and next pointers. Because the local prev and next variables are optionals and may be nil, so we use optional chaining here.
     
        3. If the new node is being inserted at the front of the list, we need to update the head pointer. (Note: If the list had a tail pointer, you'd also need to update that pointer here if next == nil, because that means the last element has changed.)
     
     Note: The nodesBeforeAndAfter() and insert(atIndex) functions can also be used with a singly linked list because we don't depend on the node's previous pointer to find the previous element.
