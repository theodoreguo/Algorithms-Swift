/**
 Heap sort is an in-place sorting algorithm with worst case and average complexity of O(nâ€Šlog n).
 A heap is a partially sorted binary tree that is stored inside an array. The heap sort algorithm takes advantage of the structure of the heap to perform a fast sort.
 To sort from lowest to highest, heap sort first converts the unsorted array to a max-heap, so that the first element in the array is the largest.
 
 The basic idea is to turn the array into a binary heap structure, which has the property that it allows efficient retrieval and removal of the maximal element.
 We repeatedly "remove" the maximal element from the heap, thus building the sorted list from back to front.
 Heapsort requires random access, so can only be used on an array-like data structure.
